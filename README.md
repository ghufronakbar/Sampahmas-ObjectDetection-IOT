Haystudio is the team that developed the Sampahmas application,
which is an ecommerce application with the main point that we can
collect rewards from exchanging inorganic waste on reverese 
vending machines.

This file serves as object detection from IoT on the camera in the vending machine. This object detection uses the TensorFlow library as a Machine Learning-based detection of goods entering the vending machine.
